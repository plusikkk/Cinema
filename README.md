## Idea:
  Our main project idea is to create a website for a cinema with interactive features to make choosing a film even more fun. Our goal is to combine the convenience of obtaining information about movies with interactivity to turn a simple film search into a small     entertainment experience and increase visitor interest.

## Features:

### 1. Home Page
The main page serves as a central hub, displaying a list of films currently in theaters.  
**Key elements:**
- **Navigation Bar:** Includes the project Logo, links for User Authentication (Sign Up / Log In), and a prominent Randomizer button.  
- **Current Premieres:** Banners or a list showcasing the latest and hottest releases.

---

### 2. Film Catalog
A comprehensive list of all movies currently running and those scheduled for release soon.  
Each movie card includes:
- Poster  
- Title, Genre, Age Restriction, Rating (IMDb/Rotten Tomatoes)  
- Short Description  
- "Details" Button to navigate to the individual film page.

---

### 3. Search, Filters, and Sorting
Users can efficiently find their next movie using detailed search and filtering options:
- **Search:** by Title, Genre, Actor, or Director  
- **Filtering:**
  - Genre (Comedy, Thriller, Sci-Fi, etc.)
  - Release Date (New releases)
  - Rating (User/Critic scores)
  - Age Category (PG-13, R)

---

### 4. Individual Movie Page
A dedicated page providing all necessary information for the user to make an informed choice:
- Poster and embedded Trailer  
- Full plot Synopsis, Cast and Director list, Genre, Running Time, and Age Restriction  
- Ratings (public and critic scores)  
- Showtime Schedule — interactive and clear  
- “Select Session and Seat” button

---

### 5. Seating Selection and Ticket Purchase
After selecting a specific showtime, the user is redirected to a smooth purchase flow:
- Interactive Seating Map (cinema hall layout)  
- Seat Status Indicators (Available, Booked, VIP)  
- Checkout flow: select seats → "Buy Ticket" → order creation and confirmation

---

### 6. The "Randomizer" Feature
A fun solution for indecisive users:
- **Random Selection:** picks a random currently-running movie  
- **Filtered Randomizer:** apply filters (e.g. “Only Comedies”, “Rating 7+”) before generating

---

### 7. User Account & Authentication
A personalized experience for each user:
- Registration / Log In  
- **User Profile:** personal data (name, email, password) and order history of purchased tickets

---

### 8. About Us and Location Page
Information about the cinema network:
- Contact information (address, email, phone)  
- Interactive map (Google Maps API)  
- Details about cinema halls and schedules

---

### 9. Admin Panel
A backend interface for administrative control:
- Add / Edit / Delete films and schedules  
- Manage users and ticket orders
